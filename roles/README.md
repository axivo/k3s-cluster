# Roles

This directory contains all the Ansible roles used for provisioning and managing the K3s Kubernetes cluster. Each role has a specific purpose in the overall architecture. This document provides details about role functionality to enable accurate understanding of the cluster provisioning system. Visit the [Wiki](https://axivo.com/k3s-cluster/wiki/guide/configuration/roles), for detailed configuration instructions.

## Provisioning Workflow

The roles are applied in this general order:

1. Base System: `cluster`
2. Kubernetes: `k3s`
3. Package Manager: `helm`
4. Networking: `cilium` → `coredns` → `external-dns`
5. Security: `cert-manager`
6. Storage: `longhorn`
7. Observability: `metrics-server` → `victoria-logs` → `victoria-metrics`
8. Application Management: `argo-cd` → `kured`

## Structure

Each role typically follows this structure:

- `defaults/main.yaml`: Default variables with specific role-prefixed structure (e.g., `<role>_vars`)
- `tasks/main.yaml`: Main tasks entry point with role validation and provisioning logic
- `tasks/validation.yaml`: Validation checks to ensure prerequisites are met
- `tasks/facts.yaml`: Fact gathering for role-specific data
- `templates/`: Jinja2 templates for generating configuration files (values.yaml, etc.)
- `handlers/`: Handlers for service management and restarts
- `tasks/postinstall.yaml`: Post-installation tasks run after the main deployment
- `tasks/upgrade.yaml`: Upgrade procedures for version updates
- `tasks/reset.yaml`: Cleanup and reset procedures for removing components
- `Chart.yaml`: Role information needed for documentation generated with `helm-docs`
- `README.md`: Role documentation generated with `helm-docs`
- `README.md.gotmpl`: Role documentation template used with `helm-docs`

## Configuration Patterns

The roles follow these common patterns:

- Variables defined in `defaults/main.yaml` with specific structure using `<role>_vars` namespace
- Facts and computed values in `<role>_map` and `<role>_project` variables
- Templates for generating role `values.yaml` and Kubernetes manifests
- Run-once tasks with `run_once: true` for cluster-wide operations (usually on first server)
- Conditional execution based on node types (`when: inventory_hostname in k3s_map.server.hosts`)
- Dependencies between roles indicated with imports or includes
- Validation checks before installation with `any_errors_fatal: true`
- Idempotent operations with proper change detection and status checking
- Retry logic for network operations with `delay`, `retries`, and `until` parameters
- Handlers for service management using `notify` directive
- Secret management with no_log: true for sensitive operations
- Proper error handling with informative failure messages
- Wait conditions for ensuring services are ready
- Use of Helm for package management with specific chart versions
- Kubernetes manifest application using k8s module
- Templating with complex Jinja2 conditionals and filters
