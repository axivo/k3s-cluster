### Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive framework for deploying and managing production-ready Kubernetes clusters on bare-metal and virtual machines. It leverages Ansible automation to create resilient, fully automated K3s environments with minimal configuration effort.

The automation is built around a collection of specialized Ansible roles that handle every aspect of the cluster lifecycle, from initial deployment and configuration to ongoing maintenance and upgrades.

### Key Features

- **Core Infrastructure**: Fully automated K3s installation on Ubuntu LTS with embedded `etcd` for high availability and HAProxy with Keepalived for Kubernetes API server load balancing
- **Advanced Networking**: Cilium CNI for eBPF-based networking, replacing `kube-proxy` with optimized service load balancing and Gateway API for ingress
- **DNS Management**: CoreDNS for internal cluster DNS resolution and ExternalDNS for automatic external DNS record synchronization
- **Package Management**: Helm for simplified application deployment and management
- **Security**: TLS certificate management via `cert-manager` with automatic renewal and integration with external DNS providers
- **Storage**: Distributed block storage with Longhorn providing volume replication and backup capabilities
- **Observability**: Complete monitoring stack with Metrics Server for core resource metrics, VictoriaMetrics for advanced metrics collection, AlertManager for alert handling and routing, VictoriaLogs for centralized logging, and Grafana for visualization
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD for declarative application deployment following GitOps principles
- **Maintenance**: Coordinated node updates with Kured for minimizing disruption during system maintenance

### Claude's Review

A [public session](https://claude.ai/share/8ccaba98-ebb2-4b1a-8bbe-79fa0bdddbf4) provides a comprehensive analysis of the cluster's architecture, technology choices, and operational characteristics, demonstrating production-grade SRE practices.
